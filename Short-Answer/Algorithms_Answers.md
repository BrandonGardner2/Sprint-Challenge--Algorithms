Add your answers to the Algorithms exercises here.

a) O(n).
Although N is cubed, the same output grows at the same rate for every input.

b)O(n^3).
There are three loops nesting dependent on N. This means the loops will grow exponentially with N. Large numbers make it more obvious.

c)O(n)
The function is recursive, but the recursion solely relies on bunnies(n). It will only grow when bunnies grow.
